Yabdt (Yet another boundary detection tool).

Yabdt is a trajectory generator written in C++, it uses OPENCV libraries to process images aiming to generate a trajectory in a 2D space that replicates the boundary of the image. 

In order to processes images YABDT makes some transofrmations (cfr source code or PDF file) and then extracts external boundary points and prints their coordinates (xy space) according to Matlab vector syntax. 

This program uses opencv lib in order to perform trasformations and boundary detection. This program is an open source software realesed under MIT License See the LICENSE (or the header) file for further details about License

YABDT has been created for a course project at uniNa, it has been succesfully utilised for visual based trajectory generation, more details are explained in the project relation YABDT.pdf included in the project. The relation is written in Italian but it's full of images and examples that make it readeble for a non-italian speaker as well. 

Live long and prosper
