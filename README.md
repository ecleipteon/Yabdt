Yabdt: Yet another boundary detection tool

Yabdt processes images (tested on jpg and png but should work on other formats too) to exract external boundary points and prints their coordinates (xy space) according to Matlab vector syntax. This program uses opencv lib to perform the boundary detection. This program is an open source software realesed under MIT License See the LICENSE (or the header) file for further details about License
